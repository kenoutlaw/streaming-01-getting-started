# streaming-01-getting-started

## Introduction
* No Programming Experience Required
* There is no prerequisite for this course. 
* It is highly recommended that you take 608-Data Analytics Fundamentals first. 
* We do not assume any background in computer science or data science.
* We expect masters level students who want to learn - and be able to apply what they know to perform novel data analytics. 
* Try to read the code and see what you can figure out. 
* Try to change small things and see what happens - curiosity and courage will be helpful!
* When you get stuck, try a web search - we learn a lot that way in both industry and academia. 
* When that still doesn't work, use the discussion forum. We'll adapt until everyone is successful. 
 
## Prerequisites

You should have these downloaded and installed on your machine:

* Python 3.10 or higher

* VS Code

* VS Code Extension: Python

* Git (configured with user.name and user.email - the same email you use for GitHub)


### Verify Installations / Update Default Python

In VS Code, open a terminal window (View / Terminal) and verify your software is installed and configured.

If Mac/Linux, the default terminal should work.

If Windows, be sure you're using a PowerShell terminal (rather than cmd).

### Make sure all commands complete successfully. 
If not, post your screenshots and the text of the error message in the discussion.
They all must run successfully before continuing.
